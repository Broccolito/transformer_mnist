# MNIST Classification Examples Using Transformers

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the classification of MNIST dataset images using two popular deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Contents

1. **classify_mnist_pytorch.ipynb** - This notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
2. **classify_mnist_tensorflow.ipynb** - This notebook covers the classification of MNIST digits using a similar approach but utilizing TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need Python installed on your machine, along with Jupyter Notebook and the following Python packages:

- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```
bashCopy code
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib torch tensorflow
```

## Running the Notebooks

To start the Jupyter Notebook server, run the following command in your terminal:

```
bashCopy code
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the notebook file you wish to run, and open it. You can execute the cells sequentially to see each step of the neural network training and evaluation process.
